        <p>Recognizing A Dose of Reveal's need for a robust online presence for their wellness products, I took the initiative to independently learn and implement a full Shopify e-commerce solution. This project demonstrates my ability to rapidly acquire new platform knowledge as I successfully designed, built, and launched the store from the ground up, managing everything from product catalog and payment integration to theme customization and order processing workflows.</p>
