                  Hi, my name is Makayla. I’d describe myself as a creative and adaptable developer who enjoys making web experiences that feel engaging and interactive. I’m still growing in my journey, but I like to learn as I go and let my creativity flow into every project I take on.
                  One of my proudest experiences has been working with my ongoing client, where I not only built an e-commerce platform but also helped them understand and use AI tools.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I guided them on how to prompt their AI-powered website so it could manage updates and content, while I continue to oversee and refine the site. That experience alone made me want to dive deeper into web development — I started coding more with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, which helped me grow my skills and better understand how AI-powered websites function.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In general, I love what I do: designing, brainstorming for my next project, and exploring visual design ideas I can bring to life. I enjoy experimenting, staying curious, and finding creative ways to grow with every project I take on.
                  I’m always excited to keep learning, take on new projects, and collaborate with others. If you’re looking for someone who’s eager, creative, and ready to contribute, I’d love to connect.
                </p>
